To the creator of FaceTrackNoIR: Never remove free software from the internet, if your newer version is worth it, people will buy it, forcing sales by removing the older free version is something you do when your newer software isn't worth it and few are buying it.


Uploading this because I had installed 1.7, and a few days later decided to buy and install 2.0. This made me unable to uninstall 1.7.

So I needed to download 1.7 again, so I could uninstall it correctly (could have manually done it but this never should be required). This is when I noticed the author (within two weeks of my purchase) went and stripped every possible download of the free 1.7 version from all over the internet, including a russian site.

He changed the existing version on soureforge to 2.0 -> please buy, and removed the 1.7 binaries. After an hour of searching the web, I managed to find a copy of 1.7 on some obscure website he didn't have control over. I was able to uninstall 1.7 sucessfully.


You are a complete asshole. I don't care about your story, you took something that was free for YEARS down, to force people to pay for your "newer" version.

What actually makes this worse? I ONLY bought your new version because I liked your 1.7 version, even if it was years old. I find it really odd that for a LONG time you had the free 1.7 version AND 2.0 paid version co-existing, and within a short time of my purchase you removed all the free versions. Maybe no one bought your stuff in so long, that you were reminded when I bought it. Maybe it was just odd timing. Either ways it doesn't matter, that was a prick move.
